# @alpha-lambda/handler

Tiny wrapper that ensures that [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda-url] function's callback is always called. In other words, from your handler you can return value, promise, throw exception, and this library will wrap your code into a promise while calling appropriate lambda-required callback. Your handler is composed of middleware, similar to [Express][express-url] or [Koa][koa-url].

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @alpha-lambda/handler
```

## Usage

```js
const handler = require('@alpha-lambda/handler');
const pino = require('pino');

module.exports.handler = handler()
	.use(async (event, context, next) => {
		// this is some middleware
		// this will forward to next function in the chain
		await next();
		// you can do things, like logging, after the fact
		// you can also override the return value=
	})
	.with({
		log: pino() // this will be accessible as context.log
	})
	.use((event, context) => {
		context.log.info({ event }, 'incoming event');
		return 'Hello, world!';
	});
```

### .use(middleware)
Adds middleware of the `function(event, context, next) {}` form to the chain.

### .with(extensions)
Adds extensions to the context. Extensions are grouped into sections. If context has a section already, new keys will be merged in, but will not override existing ones.

### next()

The `next()` function takes up to three arguments: `(err, context, event)`.

If you specify `err`, then execution is rejected with it. You can also (optionally) specify context/event to override those values for subsequent middleware.

Examples:

```js
next(); // no err, no override for context/event
next(new Error('failure!')); // rejected with Error
next(null, {}); // context is overriden
next(null, null, {}); // event is overriden
next(null, {}, {}); // both context and event are overriden
```

## Middleware

Use these middleware to extend functionality.
